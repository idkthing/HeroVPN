      <h3><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link"></span> How HeroVPN works</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>HeroVPN is a fully in website proxy, when we recieve your request our servers go to work.</li>

        <li>When we recieve your request, first clean and analize the url. Once our team of expert algorithms determines the url is safe, we verify you are a human.</li>
        <li>The our server spins up a request to your desired website and voila, our servers can now prepare it for you!</li>
        <li>We then search through the website preparing all third-party resources to be redirected to us. This step ensures your browser can't send any naughty requests to track you.</li>
        <li>After those steps we can finally send all that data over to you with <b>Secure Hypertext Transfer Protocol<b/> so that you can go about your day with peace of mind.</li>
      </ul>

    Please do work through the Getting Started guide, even if you do know how to build such an application.  The guide covers the basics of working with Heroku, and will familiarize you with all the concepts you need in order to build and deploy your own apps.
